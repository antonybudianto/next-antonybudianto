Hello, today I would like to share how to make 3D Web app using
@react-three/fiber and lastly, how to import your Blender model to
Web.

# Prerequisites

I used
<a href="https://nextjs.org/" class="underline text-blue-400">
Next.js</a>
in my recent 3D projects, but it's not required. You can use any React
boilerplate/starter you want (Next, CRA, etc). <br />
You need
<a
class="text-blue-400 underline"
href="https://www.blender.org/">
Blender</a>
software if you want to use CAD for creating your 3D model.

## Install

You can install required dependencies using:

```
npm i three @react-three/fiber
```

### Render "Hello box"

Let's do simple "hello world" by rendering simple Box in our scene:

```
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Box(props) {
  return (
    <mesh {...props}>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </mesh>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[-2, 2, 10]} />
    <Box position={[2, -2, 0]} scale={1} />
  </Canvas>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

<img
class="border"
style="height: 220px"
alt="box"
src="https://i.ibb.co/bRYqtwS/Screen-Shot-2021-08-21-at-8-04-26-PM.png"
/>
<br />
Alongside the box, we also render a
<a
            href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight"
            class="underline text-blue-500"
          >
light</a>
so that we can see our object on scene. You can set the position for
the Box with
<a
            href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3"
            class="underline text-blue-500"
          >
Vector3</a>
(3 item array: x, y, z). You'll use Vector3 a lot since it's the most
basic unit in 3D, it'll be used for object position, scale, rotation,
etc.

### Import model from Blender

Three.js offers basic geometries that you can use direcly such as Box,
Sphere, and so on. They're good for procedural rendering which don't
have model loading cost. For instance, you want to render simple chess
tiles, or simple plane, you might not need to import Model at all.
<br />
In most cases, you'll create your model in CAD software and import
them to another medium (Web, Unity, etc). Three.js allows you to
import model from CAD software (Blender, Maya, etc) by using glTF
extension, it's one of standard format for 3D scenes and model. <br />
<br />
From Blender UI, you can export by click menu File > Export > glTF 2.0
<br />
<img

alt="blender"
src="https://i.ibb.co/w4PbMNG/Screen-Shot-2021-08-21-at-8-36-08-PM.jpg"
/>
You can save as "hello.gltf" for now. <br />

##### Import glTF with @react-three/drei

We'll use another helper package for handling glTF loading. Let's
install: <br />

```
npm i @react-three/drei
```

We need to convert our glTF into React Three Fiber format, we can use
<a href="https://gltf.pmnd.rs/" class="underline text-blue-500">
https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
</a> for that. Go to the site, drag and drop your glTF, and you can copy paste your
Model component from there. The site also previews your model and
you'll get something like: <br />

```
// Auto-generated by: https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx

import React, { useRef } from 'react'
import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'

export default function Model(props) {
  const group = useRef()
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF('/hello.gltf')
  return ( ...
```

Next, copy your glTF file into your `public` folder, it should be
accessible from your server host. (e.g. http://localhost/hello.gltf)
<br />
<br />
Finally, you can import your model into your scene: <br />

```
import Model from './Model'
...
<Canvas>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <Model position={[0.2, -1.3, 0.5]} />
  </Suspense>
  <pointLight position={[-2, 2, 10]} />
</Canvas>
```

Congrats! Your model finally shows up on your Web! One more thing, you
might notice that we use React `Suspense` to handle potential asset
loading state from our Model. <br />
<br />
As a bonus, you can use drei Stage for fast Scene prototyping like
Camera, Light setup, etc. Example: <br />

```
import React, { Suspense, useRef } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { OrbitControls, Stage } from "@react-three/drei";

import Model from "./Model";

...
const ref = useRef();
...

<Canvas>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <Stage
      controls={ref}
      preset="rembrandt"
      intensity={1}
      environment="city"
    >
      <Model />
    </Stage>
  </Suspense>
  <OrbitControls ref={ref} autoRotate />
</Canvas>
```

<br />
We can use OrbitControls to have the camera to orbit around your
object (like a product showcase in stores âœ¨), and user can also zoom
and pan on the scene.

I think that's all for today, thanks for reading until this far,
I hope this post will be useful for you, see you next time!
